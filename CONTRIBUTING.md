## Updating Your Fork

The latest and greatest source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS).  
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.  

You may fork Bootstrap CMS:  

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).  

You can then update the branch:  

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.  


## Pull Requests

Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.  

* Bug fixes shouldn't be sent to the master branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.  
* Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title.  
* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) and [PHP-FIG Naming Conventions](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/bylaws/002-psr-naming-conventions.md).
